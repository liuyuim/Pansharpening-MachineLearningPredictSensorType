Leveraging Deep Learning and Feature-Based Classification for Sensor-Agnostic Pansharpening
This repository contains sample code accompanying the paper "Leveraging Deep Learning and Feature-Based Classification for Sensor-Agnostic Pansharpening". The code demonstrates the implementation of a sensor type prediction module, which is an integral component of the pansharpening process.

Overview
In this project, we provide code for building and evaluating a sensor type prediction model. The model takes evaluation metrics and corresponding sensor types as features and labels, respectively. We employ Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to train the prediction model.
